# Necklace

In species where the reference genome or annotation is incomplete, 
RNA-Seq analyses can benefit from performing a genome-guided and de 
novo assembly, in addition to using the reference annotation. 
Necklace is a software pipeline to run genome-guided and de novo assembly 
and combine the resulting transcriptomes with reference genome annotations. 
Necklace constructs a compact but comprehensive superTranscriptome 
(see https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-017-1284-1)
out of the assembled and reference data. Reads are subsequently aligned 
and counted in preparation for differential gene expression testing and 
isoform usage analysis.
